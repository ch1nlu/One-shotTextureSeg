# One-shotTextureSeg

## Project objective

The objective of our work is to design an one-shot texture segmentation deep learning pipeline which is robust to scale variance and rotation. The codes are implemented mainly on Keras API provided in Tensorflow. We also provide the numpy code to generate the texture collage dataset, which is one of the training datasets we are using to evaluate the performance of our neural network.
