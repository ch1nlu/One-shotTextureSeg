# One-shotTextureSeg

## Project objective

The objective of our work is to build an one-shot texture segmentation deep learning pipeline which is robust to scale variance and rotation. We provide the numpy code to generate the texture collage dataset, which is the training dataset we used to train the network. Our work is mainly based on the [OSTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02654) paper. We provide some qualitative results as follows.
