# One-shotTextureSeg

## Project objective

The objective of our work is to build an one-shot texture segmentation deep learning pipeline which is robust to scale variance and rotation. We provide the numpy code to generate the texture collage dataset, which is one of the training datasets we are using to evaluate the performance of our neural network. Our work is mainly based on the [OSTS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02654) paper. We provide some qualitative results in the 'results' folder.
